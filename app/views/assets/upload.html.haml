  Asset uploader
%p 
  This is a dedicated uploader for asset files. It's more informative than the standard http upload, a bit more reliable with large files and allows you to upload many files at once.

        to begin, choose one or more files

%p
  Each file you select - you can pick as many as you like in the file dialog and add more to the queue by clicking 'choose more files' - will begin to upload automatically. When the upload is complete, you'll see a compact description form for that file that allows you to override the default title, caption and copyright messages.
